                    EZRandomizer was created as a practice project to develop and solidify HTML, JavaScript, and CSS knowledge and skills. It was created using "native" HTML, JavaScript, and CSS (no additional JavaScript frameworks, such as React, or CSS preprocessors, such as LESS). Icons used throughout the app were created by Google and are availble through Google's Material Icons library.
